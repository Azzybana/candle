# candle-stable-diffusion: A Diffusers API in Rust/Candle

![rusty robot holding a candle](./assets/stable-diffusion-xl.jpg)

_A rusty robot holding a fire torch in its hand_, generated by Stable Diffusion
XL using Rust and [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle).

The `stable-diffusion` example is a conversion of
[diffusers-rs](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/diffusers-rs) using candle
rather than libtorch. This implementation supports Stable Diffusion v1.5, v2.1,
as well as Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, and Turbo.

## Getting the weights

The weights are automatically downloaded for you from the [HuggingFace
Hub](https://huggingface.co/) on the first run. There are various command line
flags to use local files instead, run with `--help` to learn about them.

## Running some example.

```bash
cargo run --example stable-diffusion --release \
    -- --prompt "a cosmonaut on a horse (hd, realistic, high-def)"
```

The final image is named `sd_final.png` by default. The Turbo version is much
faster than previous versions, to give it a try add a `--sd-version turbo` flag,
e.g.:

```bash
cargo run --example stable-diffusion --release \
    -- --prompt "a cosmonaut on a horse (hd, realistic, high-def)" --sd-version turbo
```

The default scheduler for the v1.5, v2.1 and XL 1.0 version is the Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Model scheduler (DDIM). The original paper and some code can
be found in the [associated repo](https://github.com/ermongroup/ddim).
The default scheduler for the XL Turbo version is the Euler Ancestral scheduler.

### Command-line flags

- `--prompt`: the prompt to be used to generate the image.
- `--uncond-prompt`: the optional unconditional prompt.
- `--sd-version`: the Stable Diffusion version to use, can be `v1-5`, `v2-1`,
  `xl`, or `turbo`.
- `--cpu`: use the cpu rather than the gpu (much slower).
- `--height`, `--width`: set the height and width for the generated image.
- `--n-steps`: the number of steps to be used in the diffusion process.
- `--num-samples`: the number of samples to generate iteratively.
- `--bsize`: the numbers of samples to generate simultaneously.
- `--final-image`: the filename for the generated image(s).

### Memory Issues

This requires a GPU with more than 8GB of memory, as a fallback the CPU version can be used
with the `--cpu` flag but is much slower.
Alternatively, reducing the height and width with the `--height` and `--width`
flag is likely to reduce memory usage significantly.
